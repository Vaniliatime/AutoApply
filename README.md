## File Guide

### `template.pdf` (Cover Letter PDF Template)

`template.pdf` is the visual template used for generating cover letters in PDF format.
It contains your preferred layout, fonts, header, footer, and contact information, but **does not include the cover letter text itself** (which is inserted automatically).

**To create your own template:**
1. Design an A4 PDF in any editor (Word, Google Docs, Canva, Photoshop, etc.), including your contact details, header/footer, logo, or any custom branding.
2. Leave a large empty space for the cover letter body (usually centered on the page).
3. Export as PDF and save as `template.pdf` in your project directory.
4. The app will overlay generated cover letter content into this template when producing final PDFs.

### `profile.txt` (Candidate Profile)

`profile.txt` stores your personal profile and skills.  
The content of this file is used to tailor cover letters to your experience.

**How to edit:**
- Open `profile.txt` in any text editor.
- Add a summary of your background, experience, key skills, certifications, and any information that should be reflected in your cover letters.

**Example:**
```

## Privacy

Your application data is never sent outside your own computer. All files (`applications_history.csv`, `cover-letters/`, `profile.txt`) are local. Only cover letter generation uses OpenAI's API; your key is kept secure via `.env`.
